This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library within a React Native project.  The issue manifests as an inability to access the selected image's URI after a successful image selection. The `uri` property of the selected image object is either undefined or null, even though the selection process completes without errors. This makes it impossible to display or further process the selected image within the application.
